### Potential of using the new Pymer4 (version 0.9.2)

Pymer4 version 0.9.2 can derive confidence intervals via bootstrapping 
for fitted fixed-effects, and the standard deviation of all random-effects.

While this is a significant development it does not provide per-station and per-event
confidence intervals, so it cannot replace the existing solution offered by [our fork 
of Pymer4](https://github.com/ucgmsim/pymer4/tree/get_ranef_cond_std).

The per-station and per-event random effect values provided by MERA are formally 
called _conditional modes_, or _Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs)_
, so we require confidence intervals (CIs) for the BLUPs.

`# TODO: Add support for returning coef(model) for BLUPs CIs` suggests that the
developers may eventually add this feature.
